## Code Contributions

We appreciate and welcome any code contributions. To make a PR you must first fork the repo and then make a PR from the
branch you created.

Rules:

- Make a comment on the ticket you would like to work on so we can assign it to you and to prevent duplicate efforts
- Check for existing issues before making a new one
- We may close an issue or PR without much feedback
- Stay away from PRs that:
  - Refactor large parts of the codebase
  - Add entirely new features without prior discussion
  - Change the tooling or frameworks used without prior discussion
  - Introduce new unnecessary dependencies
